					<h1 class="page__title">Design principles</h1>
					<p>When making design decisions, we need to choose among possible solutions. Design principles help to decide what to prioritize for.</p>

					<p>Our identified design principles:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="#this-is-for-everyone">This is for everyone</a></li>
						<li><a href="#content-first">Content first</a></li>
						<li><a href="#open-to-collaboration">Open to collaboration</a></li>
						<li><a href="#trustworthy-yet-joyful">Trustworthy yet joyful</a></li>
						<li><a href="#design-for-consistency">Design for consistency</a></li>
					</ul>

					<section id="this-is-for-everyone">
						<h2>This is for everyone</h2>
						<p>We aim to support a very diverse audience as a core part of our mission. It's a priority to help users overcome the different barriers between them and the knowledge our projects provide. These barriers include accessibility, language, device capabilities, network, and peoples’ technical expertise — among others. When improving the experience for a given group of people, we need to make sure we are not increasing the barriers for others.</p>

					<section id="content-first">
						<h2>Content first</h2>
						<p>People come to Wikimedia projects for their content. Therefore our solutions should help to facilitate its creation, consumption and sharing — without getting in the way. Our content (facts, images, quotes, etc.) is our most representative element, and needs to be emphasized in our solutions.</p>

					<section id="open-to-collaboration">
						<h2>Open to collaboration</h2>
						<p>Our projects are collaborative. Discussion and sharing are key factors to consider. To support diversity and a global mission, our solutions need to provide room for extension and customization to particular needs and different perspectives.</p>

					<section id="trustworthy-yet-joyful">
						<h2>Trustworthy yet joyful</h2>
						<p>Wikimedia projects provide reliable educational knowledge. At the same time, our projects are a source of entertainment and satisfy human curiosity. This requires us to find the right balance: we need to convey trust with our solutions but still remain entertaining and fresh.</p>

					<section id="design-for-consistency">
						<h2>Design for consistency</h2>
						<p>In order to facilitate understanding it is important to rely on familiar concepts. Keeping consistency within our designs, and maintaining common patterns helps people relate quickly and orientate easily.</p>

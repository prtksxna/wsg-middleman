title: WikimediaUI Style Guide – provided by Wikimedia Foundation design team
---

					<h1 class="page__title">Introduction</h1>
					<p>Wikimedia is a global movement built by a diverse audience.</p>
					<p>This style guide provides a general design direction for different kinds of interactive projects to serve our diverse communities. Designers and developers will find design recommendations to solve general problems, so that they can focus on the specific needs of their projects.</p>
					<p>This is an ongoing work, you can always check online <a href="https://wikimedia.github.io/WikimediaUI-Style-Guide/">the latest version of the guide</a>. You are welcome to help make it grow.</p>

						<h2>How to contribute</h2>
						<p>You can participate in many ways. The documentation is available in a Git repository with the design assets needed for your project. You can get all of them, change anything and send the changes back.</p>

						<h3>Get the design repository</h3>
						<p>The <a href="https://github.com/wikimedia/WikimediaUI-Style-Guide/">WikimediaUI Style Guide repository is available to download</a>. It contains this documentation, Sketch and SVG templates and resources. Select the “clone or download” button to get the repository.</p>

						<h3>Commit changes</h3>
						<p>Easily contribute to the content of the style guide by adding new recommendations, making corrections or adding examples in the form of images or videos: </p>
						<p>If you have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">Git</a> installed on your system, <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/">cloning</a> is preferred way to get the contents since it allows you to contribute back. Technically changes can be submitted as usual in Git.</p>
						<p>In order to publish the updated contents to be available live, go to the repo and launch the following command from a terminal: <code>git push -f origin master:gh-pages</code></p>
						<p>Please add specific topics into a single commit and also take into account the <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Gerrit/Commit_message_guidelines" target="_blank">Wikimedia commit message guidelines</a>.</p>

						<h3>Contribute beyond content</h3>
						<p>You can also help to improve how this documentation looks and works.</p>
						<p>When modifying aspects such as the CSS styling you'll need to rebuild the documentation files using <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> (which requires <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node">Node.js and npm</a>). The first time you have to run <code>npm install</code> in a terminal from the style guide's main folder in order to get all necessary dependencies. Every time you want to rebuild the CSS files for the documentation you just need to launch the <code>grunt</code> command in a terminal, also from the main folder.<br>
						We're using <a href="http://stylelint.io/">stylelint</a> to ensure the CSS <a href="https://github.com/wikimedia/stylelint-config-wikimedia/">aligns with our</a> <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Coding_conventions/CSS">coding conventions</a>.</p>
						<p>These requirements provide our contributors a reliable environment and our viewers a performant experience.</p>
